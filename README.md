# Memorial website

student id - 206795429

I have decided to create a website to honor the memory of my father who passed away last December 2024.
**Website logo** - the website logo contains the first letter of my fathers first name - N (Nissim), a candle, a bible book and a star of david.
All these symbols characterize him as a believing Jew.

The website contains the following categories:

- **About Him:** Details about his life and family, things he experienced while alive, and the illness he bravely faced.
- **His Photos:** A picture from his youth, a picture from the day of my parents' wedding, and a family picture.
  The family was his whole world, and he truly was our entire world.
-**His Playlist:** The website includes the song he loved and information about it. You can also listen to the song on my website!
- **Like:** If you enjoyed the website, you can click the Like button to show your support!
  Additionally, there's an option to Like the page of "Zichron Menachem," a non-profit organization dedicated to helping children
  with cancer and supporting their families during difficult times.
  I included the link to their website, where you can explore all the wonderful things the organization does.
  I heard about the organization when I chose to donate hair after my father was first diagnosed with the illness, and I donated again
  after his passing.
- **QR code:** You can scan the QR code provided on the website for direct access.
- **Q&A:** Answers to HW questions about web development and differences.
- **Contact:** If you're impressed by the website, you can send me an email with any comments, feelings, or anything else on your mind.

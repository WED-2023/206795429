<h1>This website is created in memory of my dear father Nisim Tzaig</h1>
<p>
<h3>About Me</h2>
<br/>
<br/>
Both Grandma and Grandpa, my father's parents, immigrated to Israel in 1951 from Iraq.<br/>
They married soon after they met.<br/>
My father was born on 1959.<br/>
He had a modest and joyful childhood.<br/>
He studied in "Beit Yaacov" school in Rehovot, and also helped at home as best he could.<br/>
He went with my Grandpa to his job and helped him there, and also helped my Grandma sell items crafted by her.<br/>
After he graduated, he served the Israeli Air Force as an airplane technician.<br/>
After he finished his service, he started working in "Tenuva" dairy in Rehovot.<br/>
He married my mom Rachel on 1991 and my older sister was born soon after on 1992.<br/>
We are 3 sisters. My older sister got married and gave birth to my beautiful niece, whom my father loved more than ever.<br/>
On September 2021 my father was diagnosed with cancer, and after a prolonged battle with the disease, <br/>
he passed away last December.
My father was a kind, smart and generous man.
His memory will always be with us.

<h3>My playlist</h3>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>
  My father's favorite song was "Hallelujah " performed by singer Lucy Thomas.<br/>
  "Hallelujah" is a song written by Canadian singer Leonard Cohen.<br/>
  Through the lyrics, we encounter faith, doubt, and ultimately praise.<br/>
  When i here the song nowdays I feel it describes my father wish to live against all odds.<br/>
  You can listen to the song below ðŸ‘‡<br/>

<h3>Ans</h3>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>
  <b>Q1. Here are some main differnces between web1, web2 and web3:</b><br/>
  <b>Level of control and authority</b><br/>
  <b>Web1:</b> Few big companies control everything.<br/>
  <b>Web2:</b> Users can participate more but still rely on big platforms like Facebook.<br/>
  <b>Web3:</b> No big boss; everyone shares control using new tech like blockchain.<br/>
  <b>What Can User Do</b><br/>
  <b>Web1:</b> You mostly just read stuff.<br/>
  <b>Web2:</b> You can post, share, and chat.<br/>
  <b>Web3:</b> You're in charge. You create content, make decisions, and own your data.<br/>
  <b>Who Owns Users Data</b><br/>
  <b>Web1:</b> Companies own your data.<br/>
  <b>Web2:</b> You have a bit more control, but companies still have a say.<br/>
  <b>Web3:</b> You own your data and control who can use it.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Q2. Here is an example of a use case showing the differences between web1, web2 and web3:</b><br/>
  <b>The use case: searching for a cake recipe across Web1, Web2, and Web3:</b><br/>
  <b>On Web1:</b> You find a static website with a single recipe owned by the website creator.<br/>
   You can only read the recipe but can't interact with it or share your own.<br/>
  <b>On Web2:</b> You discover a cooking blog where a blogger shares recipes and tips.<br/>
   You can read the recipe, interact with other users' comments, and share the recipe on social media.<br/>
   You have more interaction and sharing options compared to Web1.<br/>
  <b>On Web3:</b> You come across a decentralized recipe-sharing platform on the blockchain.<br/>
   Recipes are contributed by users globally, and everyone can add their own recipes or variations.<br/>
    Each recipe is protected by a smart contract, ensuring fair credit to the creator. You have full<br/>
    control over your data and recipes, and the community verifies the authenticity of recipes.

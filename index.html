<h1>🕯️This website is created in memory of my dear father Nissim Tzaig🕯️</h1>

<section id="about" class="section">
<br/>
<h3>About Him</h3>
<p>
Both Grandma and Grandpa, my father's parents, immigrated to Israel from Iraq in 1951. They married<br/>
soon after meeting each other. My father was born in 1959 and had a modest and joyful childhood. He<br/>
attended "Beit Yaacov" school in Rehovot and also helped at home as best he could. He often accompanied<br/>
my Grandpa to his job and assisted him there, as well as helping my Grandma sell items crafted by her.<br/>
<br/>
After graduating, he served in the Israeli Air Force as an airplane technician. Following his military<br/>
service, he began working at "Tenuva" dairy in Rehovot. He married my mom Rachel in 1991, and my older<br/>
sister was born soon after in 1992. We are three sisters in total. My older sister got married and gave<br/>
birth to my beautiful niece, whom my father loved more than ever.<br/>
<br/>
In September 2021, my father was diagnosed with cancer, and after a prolonged battle with the disease,<br/>
he passed away last December. My father was a kind, smart, and generous man.<br/>
His memory will always be with us.<br/>

<h3>His playlist</h3>
<p>
  My father's favorite song was "Hallelujah " performed by singer Lucy Thomas.<br/>
  "Hallelujah" is a song written by a Canadian singer named Leonard Cohen.<br/>
  Through the lyrics, we encounter faith, doubt, and ultimately praise.<br/>
  When i here the song nowdays I feel it describes my father wish to live against all odds.<br/>

<h3>Ans</h3>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>
  <b>Q1. Here are some main differnces between web1, web2 and web3:</b><br/>
  <b>Level of control and authority</b><br/>
  <b>Web1:</b> Few big companies control everything.<br/>
  <b>Web2:</b> Users can participate more but still rely on big platforms like Facebook.<br/>
  <b>Web3:</b> No big boss; everyone shares control using new tech like blockchain.<br/>
  <br/>
  <b>What Can User Do</b><br/>
  <b>Web1:</b> You mostly just read stuff.<br/>
  <b>Web2:</b> You can post, share, and chat.<br/>
  <b>Web3:</b> You're in charge. You create content, make decisions, and own your data.<br/>
  <br/>
  <b>Who Owns Users Data</b><br/>
  <b>Web1:</b> Companies own your data.<br/>
  <b>Web2:</b> You have a bit more control, but companies still have a say.<br/>
  <b>Web3:</b> You own your data and control who can use it.<br/>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  <b>Q2. Here is an example of a use case showing the differences between web1, web2 and web3:</b><br/>
  <b>The use case: searching for a cake recipe across Web1, Web2, and Web3:</b><br/>
  <b>On Web1:</b> You find a static website with a single recipe owned by the website creator.<br/>
   You can only read the recipe but can't interact with it or share your own.<br/>
  <b>On Web2:</b> You discover a cooking blog where a blogger shares recipes and tips.<br/>
   You can read the recipe, interact with other users' comments, and share the recipe on social media.<br/>
   You have more interaction and sharing options compared to Web1.<br/>
  <b>On Web3:</b> You come across a decentralized recipe-sharing platform on the blockchain.<br/>
   Recipes are contributed by users globally, and everyone can add their own recipes or variations.<br/>
    Each recipe is protected by a smart contract, ensuring fair credit to the creator. You have full<br/>
    control over your data and recipes, and the community verifies the authenticity of recipes.
